Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). 
It allows for better management of dependencies, improved testability, and more maintainable code. 
In Flutter, DI can be achieved using packages like provider or get_it.

Without DI: Each widget or class that needs an instance of CounterBloc has to create it manually.
With DI: CounterBloc is created in a centralized location (the root of the widget tree), 
         and all widgets that need it can access it without creating their own instance.

Without DI: Testing individual widgets or classes becomes harder because you have to handle dependencies manually,
            often needing to mock or stub them.
With DI: You can easily inject mock or test versions of dependencies during testing, 
         simplifying the setup of unit tests and making them more reliable.
